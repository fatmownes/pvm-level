# PvM Level plugin



Number goes up!

A Runelite plugin that calculates a sudo-level based off of player's bossing Hiscores.

Adds these sudo levels to the player right-click menu, and adds 
a plugin panel that will break down there level, by displaying 
their hiscores in order, with a touch of flair.

I will publish a finalized leveling algorithm when I decide on it.
